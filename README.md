# Worldschool Canon

The permanent, community-curated collection of tools, courses, and ebooks that form the memetic basics of Worldschool University.  

For families raising sovereign, location-independent minds — anywhere on Earth.

## What's inside
- **10 core categories**: From First-Principles Thinking to the Dangerous Corner.
- **100+ hand-picked gems**: Books like *Free to Learn* (Peter Gray), tools like Anki decks, courses like Khan Academy pathways.
- **Open to all**: Fork, contribute, build on it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Quick start
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/yonkoll/worldschool-canon.git`
2. Open `resources.json` — that's the magic.
3. Deploy your fork to Vercel/Netlify in one click for a live site.

## Why this exists
Industrial schooling is dying. Worldschooling is rising. This canon is the shared repository of antifragile ideas every family needs — no credentials required.

Built with ❤️ for the next generation.
