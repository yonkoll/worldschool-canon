# How to add a resource to the Worldschool Canon

1. Fork this repo
2. Edit resources.json (or the relevant category file)
3. Add your resource in this format:
   {
     "title": "",
     "author": "",
     "why": "One sentence why this belongs in the canon",
     "link": "",
     "cover": "" (optional direct image URL)
   }
4. Open a Pull Request titled “Add [Resource Name]”

The canon is opinionated but generous — if it truly helps raise sovereign minds, it belongs here.
